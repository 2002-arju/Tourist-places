         <h3>TAJ MAHAL</h3>
            <P>The Taj Mahal, Agra
                Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the
                 world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz
                  Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of
                   mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen 
                   until 1648 to complete.
                
                Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets
                , an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around the entrance, 
                the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble. Adding to its
                 splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious
                  stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.<br></P>

                    Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history
                     and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in
                      1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its
                       beautiful gold decoration.
                    
                    The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus
                     and people of other faiths), the temple was built in a blend of 
                      and Islamic styles. Its lower marble section features such flourishes
                       as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden
                        dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs.<br> </p></div>

                    <h3>AMER FORT</h3>
                    <P>Amer Fort, Jaipur
                        Amer Fort (often also spelt "Amber") was built as a fortified palace
                         in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh I and has long served as the capital 
                         of Jaipur. Carved high up into the hillside, the fort is accessible
                          on foot via a steep climb or by shuttle rides from the town below
                           (better still, let an elephant do the work).
                        
                        Highlights include Jaleb Chowk, the first courtyard, with its many
                         decorated elephants, and the Shila Devi Temple, dedicated to the
                          goddess of war. Also of note is the adjoining Hall of Public
                           Audience (Diwan-i-Am) with its finely decorated walls and 
                           terraces frequented by monkeys.<br></P>
