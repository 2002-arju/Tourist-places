                <p>
                    <div>India is the largest country in the South Asian region, located primarily in the center of the subcontinent. 
                    The country shares land borders with Pakistan to the northwest, China and Nepal to the north, Bhutan to the
                     northeast, and Bangladesh and Myanmar are to the east. Maritime borders in the Indian Ocean exist with Sri Lanka
                      to the south, Maldives to the southwest, and Indonesia to the southeast.

                The Republic of India is the seventh largest country in the world by area and, with over a billion people,
                is second only to China in population, although its much higher birth-rate makes it likely to reach pole
                position in less than ten years.</div>

                <div>It is an extremely diverse country, with vast differences in geography, climate, culture, language and 
                ethnicity across its expanse, and prides itself on being the largest democracy on Earth and a hub of 
                trade in Southeast Asia. India provides a vast canvass for touring whether it may be cultural,
                adventure, religious, history, beach, wildlife and other forms<br>

                Indians are known for treating guests according to the precept (in Sanskrit) "अतिथि देवो भवः" Atithi devo bhava meaning "A guest is like God".

                India's culture and heritage are a rich amalgam of the past and the present. This vast country offers the visitor a
                 view of fascinating religions and ethnography, a vast variety of languages - more than 438 living languages among 
                 1600 languages and thousands of dialects, and monuments that have been present for thousands of years. As it opens
                  up to a globalised world, India still has a depth of history and intensity of culture that awes and fascinates 
                  the many who visit there.

                India is considered one of the world's fastest growing economies and one of the fastest developing countries. 
                It is considered to be an emerging superpower. Therefore, your visit will indeed be an interesting one.</div>


                <div>Mesolithic sites include the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Central India, Madhya Pradesh, which are 300,000 years old. 
                 One of the three cradles of civilizations the Indus Valley Civilization flourished in Northern India. The oldest
                  archaeological site attributed to this civilization is Bhirrana(7570 BCE), located in the modern day Indian state
                   of Haryana and the largest site being Rakhigari, Haryana[7]. In the east this civilization extended as far as 
                   the modern day city of Alamgirpur,Uttar Pradesh[8].Other important sites excavated in India include Lothal,
                    Dholavira, Kalibangan and so many more [9]. This civilization came to an abrupt end around 1700 to 1500 BCE. 
                    This was followed by Vedic Period. Indians date the Vedic Period as one of the significant role in Indian Society, 
                    which scholars place in the second and first millennia BC continuing up to the 6th century BC, based on literary evidence.
                     This is the period when the Vedas, one of the oldest and important books of Sanatan Dharma, were compiled.</div>

                <div>The Vedic civilization influences Republic of India to this day. Present-day Hinduism traces its roots to the Vedas, but
                 is also heavily influenced by literature that came afterwards, like the Upanishads, the Puranas, the great epics; 
                 Ramayana and Mahabharata, and the Bhagavad Gita. By tradition, these books claim to only expand and distil the knowledge 
                 that is already present in the Vedas. Some rituals of Hinduism took shape during that period. Most North-Indian languages
                  come from Sanskrit, the language that the Vedas were first written down in, and are classified as part of the Indo-European
                   group of languages. In the 1st millennium BC, various schools of thought in philosophy developed, enriching Hinduism greatly.
                    Most of them claimed to derive from the Vedas. However, three of these schools - Sikhism , Buddhism and Jainism - 
                    questioned the authority of the Vedas and they are classified as separate religions in western discourse.</div>

              <div> Many great empires were formed between 500 BC and AD 500. Notable among them were the Mauryas and the Guptas.
                This period saw major mathematical and astronomical advancements, many of which were ahead of their time and 
                were rediscovered later in the West. In particular, Aryabhata theorised that the earth was a sphere that rotates about
                 its axis and revolves around the sun. He also developed a calendar that is followed to this day. This period also saw a gradual
                  decline of Buddhism and Jainism. The practice of Buddhism, in particular, disappeared from India's heartland, though Buddha
                   himself was incorporated into the Hindu pantheon. Jainism continues to be practiced by a significant number who are ambivalent about
                    whether they consider themselves Hindus or not. Hinduism itself went through significant changes. The importance of Vedic deities 
                    like Indra and Agni reduced and Puranic deities like Vishnu, Shiva, their various Avatars and family members gained prominence.</div>
